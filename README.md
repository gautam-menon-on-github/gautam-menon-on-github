**Hi there!**

I'm Gautam Menon, a Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (with Honours).
I'm passionate about using code to solve problems and build engaging web applications.

My main areas of interest include:
- Machine Learning
- Web Development
- Problem Solving

Projects:
- **YouTube Clone (Frontend)** - This project replicates core functionalities of YouTube using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
It is my very first web development project (and the very first project I've uploaded on GitHub)

Looking Forward To:
- Uploading more web development and machine learning projects.
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks.

Feel free to reach out!
